# Real-Time Train Departure Time Tracker
This code is a script that makes a GET request to a specified URL, retrieves data in JSON format, processes that data to find the time until the next train departure, and writes that time to a text file. It uses the python library requests to make the GET request, json to process the response, and datetime to calculate the time until the next train departure. It runs in an infinite loop and sleeps for 20 seconds between each iteration. The script filters out the trains that are not heading in the "JourneyDirection" 2, and calculates the time left for the next train by subtracting the current time from the train departure time, and then adding a 7 minute walking time and 5 minute packing time. The time is then written to the file 'a.txt'.
